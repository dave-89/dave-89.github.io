      <description>About me I am a physicist, a software developer and a cyber security consultant. I have been working for a large bank in the UK for the last few years. Before that I completed a PhD in Mathematical Physics under the supervision of Dr Catro-Alvaredo and I have been a teaching assistant at City, University London.</description>
