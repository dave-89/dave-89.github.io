      <description>When I was an undergrad student, I&amp;rsquo;ve always been fascinated by ODE (Ordinary Differential Equation) numerical integrators. These algorithms are able to solve complex ODE, which can be used to describe - among many other things - the motion of body in space.
Among the various algorythms, I had my favourite: Runge-Kutta. Even though is not symplectic (the preservation of the constants of motions is not guaranteed by contruction), it offers very precise results.</description>
